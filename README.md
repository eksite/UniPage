# A test task for UniPage

=====================

##### Installing
Instalation requaries NPM.
Then just clone my repository and in terminal write  `npm i`. After this you need write `npm run start`.
If you want just look result you can open [this](http://eksite.github.io/UniPage).

##### Description

When you start checking  i have two different branches:
1. first_iteration_with_useRefs
2. second_iteration_with_useReducer
<br>
When I started writing the project I made a mistake and developed the project in the wrong direction.<br/> As soon as I finished and the code worked, I created a second branch where I did it in a more pleasant way (the second way is uploaded to master)
